Blackjack is classic card game written for [Python 3 Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/complete-python-bootcamp/).
***
To learn about this game you can visit the [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackjack).
***
The rules are the same as in the classic Blackjack, except for Golden Point that is implemented in my game.
Just follow the on-screen instructions.

*I'd recommend you to use the dark theme for your shell app to enjoy the visual part of the game*

### Enjoy!
